# OnePageCRM

This gem is a basic wrapper around the OnePageCRM API. 
It does not abstract all API calls to ruby methods on the gem object but simply gives the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` methods.
The gem handles all the authentication with the OnePageCRM API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'onepagecrm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install onepagecrm
